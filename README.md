## UW-Madison salaries

Following up on an effort by [UFAS](https://ufas223.org),
the [Wisconsin University Union (WUU)](https://www.wuu.info)
will be regularly submitting Open Records Requests to obtain
information on UW-Madison employees' salaries,
and making the data available.

Also see the [related tool](https://wuu-madison.github.io/salaries)
for comparing a UW-Madison employee's salary to others with the same
title. It is based on the design of Harald Kliems's [TTC Salary
mapping tool](https://haraldkliems.shinyapps.io/My_TTC_salary/).
